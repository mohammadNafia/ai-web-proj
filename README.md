 Build a React (Next.js 14) front-end only (no backend logic) for a project named “Flow”. The backend will be handled separately — do not implement any backend functions.  The website must have a dark, premium, Apple-style look inspired by game-theory design principles (smooth motion, minimal text, cinematic feel). All text should be in English.
